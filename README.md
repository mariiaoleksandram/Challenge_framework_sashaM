Task 1: software configuration.

Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the Dare IT Challenge?

Hello,

My name is Mariia-Oleksandra, or shorter: Sasha : ) I decided to take part in DareIT challenge because at that moment I was looking for a good opportunity to tip my toes into game development, specifically programming. I am young and in desperate need of filling my head with new interesting knowledge which will help me to build my future. After I found myself in Poland at 18 years old with no proper education, life skills or work experience, the lowest niche of game development, video game testing be it, has welcomed me and it made me believe I could someday get higher in this field and do some cool things on my own.

Have a lovely day or night, whenever you read it : )
